                <br><br>
                    So I would like to discuss three (3) of my main strengths in the following:<br> <br>
                    <li><b>Musical Strength:</b> Some would say I am a very talented person due<br> to the fact that I can sing and play several instruments well. Though <br>the thought of it being true makes me happy, over the years I have learnt that <br> there is humility in accepting that there exists someone that is better than me. <br>This therefore means that there is always room for improvement and I<br> should continue to work on my craft by practicing as often as possible.  </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>My abitlity to persuade:</b> I find that since the  pandemic started I<br> have become even better with my choice of words when having conversations.<br>This has made me even more convincing when trying to appeal to someone's conscience.<br>Don't worry, I use my new found powers for good. It is still a working progress though<br>and I have been developing this skill by reading and doing research to acquire new<br> knowledge which in turn builds my vocabulary and my ability to create multi-dimentional <br>perspectives on almost any topic/situation.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Self-learning:</b> My ability to teach my self is one of my biggest skills/strengths<br> and  has especially been extremely useful since I started university. I've also<br> been developing this skill through reading and research.</li>
                    <br><br>
                </ol>
                 </font>
            </p>

        <center><h3>
            <u>The Twelve Pillars</u>
        </h3>
        <p font color="DarkBlue">
            To summarize what I have learned from the book "The Twelve Pillars" I'll be using three points:<br><br>
            <b>Write Your Goals Down</b><br> I have always had goals that I would like to acheive in life<br> but 
            it never once dawned on me that I should write them down.<br> This book taught me that when you write your goals
            down it resonates<br> in your mind and your brain begins thinking of ways to achieve them.<br> This in turn makes it more likely for you to achieve those goals.
            <br>As of now I will be applying this principle to my life.<br><br>
            <b>Surround yourself with the Best People</b><br>
            In order to achieve your goals in the best way possible, you must <br> surround yourself with people who are heading in the same direction as you. If you <br>allow yourself to be surrounded by people who have no intention of developing themselves you<br> will be stuck at the level you are at or sink even further. I've already began putting <br> this principle into practice and it has been working very well for me.
        <br><br><b>Be A Life Long Learner</b><br>
        Some of us may think that after school ends and we've gotten our <br>bachelors degree that we now know everything we need to know. But according to this book that
        <br> idea could not be any further from the truth. It states that there is always new knowledge to gain and<br> one of the best ways to
        do so is through reading. I too am a testament to the fact that reading <br>has indeed improved my knowledge capacity so much so that I've been able to teach <br>myself a lot of key skills that are important to my daily life.
